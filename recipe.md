Instructions:

Step 1: Preheat your oven to 230°C. Butter and flour your ramekin(s) well.

[ How To: Grease the entire ramekin with butter. Spoon a bit of flour into the ramekin and shake/twirl your ramekin around until all the sides are well covered. Invert your ramekin and tap out excess flour. ]

Step 2: In a heatproof bowl, combine butter, chocolate, salt, and instant espresso. Over a double boiler, melt the chocolate & butter mixture, whisking occasionally to prevent burning. If using a microwave, heat up the mixture in intervals, until the butter is melted. Stir the mixture so the heat from the butter can melt the chocolate. Let it cool for about 5-10 minutes.

Step 3: While the melted chocolate is cooling, in a separate bowl, beat the egg, egg yolk, and granulated sugar until the mixture thickens and lightens in colour. You should be able to tell when the egg mixture starts to lighten, volumise, and thicken. If you whisk it by hand, it should take about 2 minutes of thorough whisking.

Step 4: Combine the melted chocolate and egg mixture.

Step 5: Fold in the flour till it’s combined thoroughly. Stop when it’s done, do not overmix.

Step 6: Pour the batter into your prepared ramekin(s), and bake for 8 - 12 minutes (depending on oven and ramekin size). Your cakes are done when the sides are firm and set, and the centers are still slightly jiggly. There should not be wet batter at all on top. Allow the cakes to cool for a minute.

Step 7: Place a plate on the ramekin, and carefully, with a towel or oven mitten, turn over the ramekin and let it sit on the plate for 10 - 15 seconds, before carefully lifting the ramekins up. If you buttered and floured your ramekins well enough, your cakes should come out of the ramekins nicely. Serve with a dusting of confectioners’ sugar, fresh fruits, or ice cream.
